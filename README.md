# Book API

A free and Open Source Book API with Unitary tests using vitest and Authentication using JWT

## Running

To run this program, in this version, you just need to install the dependencies using

```bash
pnpm install
```

Or any other package manager that you want to use and after that use

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## TODO

As of now the API is very basic, you can see here what still needs to be done and what is already done

- [ ] Serve Endpoints
- [ ] Create middleware for errors
- [ ] Connect to a backend (choose a stack too)
- [ ] Create the authentication logic
