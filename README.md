### Requests

There is a folder with prepared requests to use with the extension Rest Client on VSCode, it is possible to use it to test the API

## TODO

As of now the API is very basic, you can see here what still needs to be done and what is already done

- [x] Serve Endpoints
- [x] Create middleware for errors
- [x] Connect to a backend (choose a stack too)
